INGREDIENTS
1 12-inch round of pizza dough, stretched
3 tablespoons tomato sauce (see note)
 Extra-virgin olive oil
2 Â¾ ounces fresh mozzarella
4 to 5 basil leaves, roughly torn

PREPARATION
Place a pizza stone or tiles on the middle rack of your oven and turn 
heat to its highest setting. Let it heat for at least an hour.
Put the sauce in the center of the stretched dough and use the back of a 
spoon to spread it evenly across the surface, stopping approximately 1/2 
inch from the edges.
Drizzle a little olive oil over the pie. Break the cheese into large 
pieces and place these gently on the sauce. Scatter basil leaves over the 
top.
Using a pizza peel, pick up the pie and slide it onto the heated stone or 
tiles in the oven. Bake until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is 
bubbling, approximately 4 to 8 minutes.
In a food processor, whiz together whole, drained canned tomatoes, a 
splash of olive oil and a sprinkle of salt. Keep leftover sauce 
refrigerated.
